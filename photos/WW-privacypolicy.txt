Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with confidence.

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Wedding Window collects information from all end users of Wedding Window's Internet services (the "Services")-those who view our Services as visitors but do not have accounts ("Visitors"), those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Trial Users") as well as those who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Users")-what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitor, Trial Users and Users have concerning the collection and use of such information. Wedding Window requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

Personal Information Wedding Window Collects and How It Is Used
Introduction. Wedding Window collects information in different ways from Visitors, Trial Users and Users who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties except for with other entities who are identified on our website and who participate in delivering products and/or services to our customers. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. Of course, the Personal Information that you may place on the site for publication as part of the Services will be made public as that is inherent in the Services. Therefore, you should choose that information wisely and avoid information that you do not wish to publish or you do not have the right to publish.


Registration. Trial Users are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, telephone number, wedding date and email address. Users also provide mailing address and billing information (such as a credit card number). The personal information collected from Users during the registration process is used to manage each User's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties by us except as needed for billing, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. Wedding Window may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Trial Users and Users provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Users). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services (not on individual User sites).


Online Shopping. At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Wedding Window has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.

If you order products directly from Wedding Window, such as through a future "Wedding Window Store," we will use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.


Online Advertisements. Wedding Window may display online advertisements. We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors Trial Users and Users collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. WeddingWindow.com does not share personal information about its Visitors, Trial Users or Users with these advertisers.


Responses to Email Inquiries. When Visitors, Trial Users or Users send email inquiries to Wedding Window, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. WeddingWindow.com does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.


Voluntary Customer Surveys. We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.


We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Wedding Window customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.


Special Cases. It is Wedding Window's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors, Trial Users or Users in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, Wedding Window may disclose personal information about Visitors Trial Users or Users, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect WeddingWindow.com and our Users.


"Cookies" and How Wedding Window Uses Them. A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. WeddingWindow.com may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a User, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information.


Additionally, be aware that if you visit non- Wedding Window Web sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies.

Advertisers and other participants may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

Wedding Window's Commitment to Data Security. Services and we provide have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
